# IN DESIGN LUXURY FABRICS — Handover Guide

## 1. Go-live checklist

| What | Where | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **UPI ID** | `src/lib/constants.ts` → `UPI.vpa` | Until it's real, payments go nowhere |
| **Editor PIN** | `src/lib/constants.ts` → `ADMIN_PIN` | Change from the default `3216` — only matters if you skip the Supabase setup in section 6 |
| WhatsApp / phone number | `src/lib/constants.ts` → `BUSINESS` | Where orders arrive |
| Free-shipping threshold, wholesale % | `src/lib/constants.ts` → `ORDER` | |
| Real photos | `public/images/…` | Every image is a placeholder |
| Logo | `public/images/logo/` | The gold mark is your real logo, already wired in. Swap the files here if it ever changes. |

## 2. Changing prices, stock and offers

**If you've set up accounts and live sync (section 6):** open `yoursite.com/#/admin`, sign in, edit, tap **Publish Live**. Done — every visitor sees it within about a second, no upload, no rebuild. Skip straight to section 3.

**If you haven't:** two routes, pick one.

### Route A — Google Sheet (best if you edit often)

Once set up, changing a price is: open Google Sheets on your phone, type the new number, done. The site follows within a few minutes. No downloads, no GitHub, no Netlify.

**One-time setup (~15 minutes):**

1. Open Google Sheets → File → Import → upload `catalog-for-google-sheets.csv` from this repo. That gives you all 12 fabrics already filled in with the right column headers.
2. File → Share → **Publish to web** → select that sheet → format **CSV** → Publish. Copy the URL it gives you.
3. Paste that URL into `CATALOG_SOURCE.sheetCsvUrl` in `src/lib/constants.ts`.
4. Rebuild and redeploy once. After this you never rebuild for a price change again.

**Daily use:** edit the sheet. That's the whole workflow.

- `stock` column: `in`, `low`, or `out`
- `tags` column: separated by `|` — e.g. `best-seller|festival`
- `pricePerMetre`: plain numbers, but `8,500` and `₹8500` also work
- `mrp`: leave blank for no strike-through price
- Google caches published sheets for a few minutes, so changes are not instant

**Trade-off:** the offer banner, reviews and product-page galleries aren't in the sheet — those stay in the editor. And anyone with the published URL can read the sheet, so don't put private notes in it.

### Route B — the built-in editor at `/#/admin`

Open `yoursite.com/#/admin` and enter the PIN.

You can change price, MRP, stock, tags, category, min metres, the short and long descriptions, the main photo and the product-page gallery, or add/remove fabrics entirely.

Then publish:

**If Netlify is connected to this GitHub repo** (the recommended setup):
1. Tap **Copy text** in the editor
2. Go to `github.com/mithesh11-max/IDF/blob/main/public/catalog.json`
3. Tap the pencil icon → select all → paste → **Commit changes**
4. Netlify rebuilds automatically in about a minute

**If you deploy by dragging the `dist` folder to Netlify:** you cannot patch a single file into a live drag-drop deploy — put the new `catalog.json` into `dist/` and drag the whole folder again. This is the main reason to connect the repo instead.

**Even without any of this**, an open browser tab quietly re-checks `catalog.json` every 45 seconds, so a customer already on the site sees your update within under a minute once it's published — not just on their next visit.

## 3. How an order works

1. Customer adds fabric by the metre → cart saves automatically.
2. **Step 1** — name, WhatsApp number, address or store pickup, notes. All validated.
3. **Step 2 — payment.** UPI only for now: QR code plus an "Open UPI App" button on phones, amount and order ID pre-filled. Or they place the order and settle at the showroom.
4. **Step 3 — confirm the send.** WhatsApp opens with the full order typed out. The site then asks *"did you press Send?"* and does **not** treat the order as placed until they say yes. If WhatsApp didn't open there's a retry button, a copy-the-order-text fallback, and the phone number.
5. **Step 4** — order confirmed, cart cleared.

**The safety net:** if someone opens WhatsApp and wanders off without sending, the order is stored as *pending*. Next time they open the site — an hour or a week later — a bar appears at the bottom: *"Order IDLF-XXXX hasn't reached the showroom yet — Send now."* Their cart is untouched until it's sent.

**Wholesale is automatic:** 20+ metres → 15% off in the cart, no code needed.

**Cards and net banking** arrive together, later, via Razorpay — see section 5.

---

## 4. Product pages

Every fabric now has its own page at `/product/<id>` — full gallery, composition, width, minimum order, Add to Cart and Buy Now, plus related fabrics from the same category. Product cards throughout the site link there. Nothing to configure; it reads from the same catalog as everywhere else, so anything you publish in the editor shows up here too.

---

## 5. Payments — what's real vs what needs Razorpay

UPI works today: QR code, deep link, no gateway account needed. Cards and net banking need an actual payment gateway — a website cannot open a bank's own login page or a card network's 3-D Secure screen; only a licensed gateway can. When you're ready:

1. Open a Razorpay (or Cashfree) account — needs business KYC, PAN, GST, bank verification.
2. Bring the API keys back here and the checkout gets a proper "Pay with Card / Net Banking" step alongside UPI, with real payment verification instead of a customer ticking a box.

Until then, payment is confirmed by the customer, not verified by a gateway — completely normal for a showroom at this stage, but worth knowing.

## 6. Accounts and live sync (optional — Supabase)

This is the biggest upgrade available and it's optional. Switching it on gets you:

- **Real accounts for reviews** — Google sign-in, or email + password + a 6-digit verification code. Only signed-in customers can leave a review; anonymous ones are no longer possible.
- **A real admin login** — username + password + a 6-digit code emailed to you, instead of a PIN. The password never lives inside the website's code, unlike a PIN, which technically does (see the note at the end of this section).
- **True live sync** — publish a price change and it's on the site for every visitor within about a second. No file upload, no waiting for the 45-second refresh.

It costs nothing at this scale (Supabase's free tier) and takes about 20–30 minutes, once, most of it clicking through dashboards rather than anything technical.

### Setup

**1. Create the project.** Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → New project. Pick any name and a database password (save it somewhere). Wait ~2 minutes for it to provision.

**2. Run the schema.** In the Supabase dashboard: SQL Editor → New query → paste the entire contents of `supabase/schema.sql` from this repo → Run. This creates the products, reviews and settings tables and locks them down so only the right people can write to each.

**3. Fix the two email templates.** By default Supabase emails a clickable link, not a 6-digit code — this site needs the code. Authentication → Email Templates:
   - **Confirm signup** → make sure the body includes `{{ .Token }}` (this is what a new customer's verification code comes from)
   - **Magic Link** → same, include `{{ .Token }}` (this is what both returning customers and the admin's login code come from)

**4. Get your API keys.** Project Settings → API. Copy the **Project URL** and the **anon public** key.

**5. Wire them into the site.** Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and paste in those two values:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
   ```
   Add the same two as environment variables in Netlify (Site settings → Environment variables) so the live build picks them up too. Rebuild once.

**6. Deploy the admin login function.** This needs the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) installed once on a computer:
   ```
   supabase login
   supabase link --project-ref xxxxx        # the ref is in your project URL
   supabase functions deploy admin-auth
   supabase secrets set ADMIN_USERNAME=admin.idf
   supabase secrets set ADMIN_PASSWORD='IDF.4U'
   supabase secrets set ADMIN_EMAIL=m.mithesh11122006@gmail.com
   ```
   Change the password to whatever you like before setting it — it's stored as an encrypted secret on Supabase's servers, never inside the website's code, so this is the one place it's actually safe to put a real password. `ADMIN_EMAIL` is where every login code gets sent, so make sure it's an inbox you check.

**7. First login.** Go to `yoursite.com/#/admin`, sign in with the username and password from step 6, enter the code emailed to `ADMIN_EMAIL`. That first successful login automatically promotes the account to admin — nothing else to configure.

**8. (Optional) Turn on Google sign-in for customers.** Authentication → Providers → Google → enable it. You'll need a Google Cloud OAuth client (console.cloud.google.com → APIs & Services → Credentials → Create OAuth client ID → Web application), with Supabase's callback URL added as an authorized redirect URI — Supabase shows you the exact URL to paste in once you toggle Google on. Without this step, email + password + code still works fine for reviews; Google is an added convenience, not a requirement.

### What changes once this is live

- `/#/admin` shows the new username/password/code login instead of the PIN.
- The **Publish Live** button replaces Copy/Download — it writes straight to the database.
- The Reviews tab becomes a moderation queue of real, signed-in submissions with Publish / Keep Private / Delete buttons, instead of a manually-typed list.
- On the storefront, "Write a Review" asks a signed-out visitor to sign in first.
- Everything in sections 1–5 keeps working exactly as described; this section only removes the file-upload step.

### Why the PIN isn't "real" security and this is

The PIN lives inside the website's own JavaScript, which means anyone can open the browser's dev tools and read it — that's true of any secret placed in frontend code, not a flaw specific to this site. It's an acceptable speed bump for a low-stakes editor with no real backend to protect, which is exactly the situation before this section. The admin password above is different because it's checked on Supabase's servers, inside a function the browser never sees the source of — that's what makes it an actual secret rather than an obscured one.

## 7. Reviews — how curation works

Customers rate 1–5 and write a note.

- **4 or 5 stars** → saved as *pending*. You publish it from the Reviews tab and it appears on the site immediately.
- **1 to 3 stars** → saved as *private*. It never appears publicly; the customer is told this upfront, and you get a chance to make it right.

Without Supabase, the same idea works over WhatsApp instead: good reviews arrive marked *OK TO PUBLISH* for you to paste into the editor; unhappy ones arrive marked *PRIVATE FEEDBACK* with a prompt to call the customer back.

**One thing to keep as it is.** The score above the reviews is calculated from exactly the reviews shown, and labelled "across N published reviews." Don't change it to an average of everything received while displaying only the good ones — that's the pattern India's review standard (BIS IS 19000:2022, which the CCPA pushes for e-commerce) treats as a deceptive practice. Curating which reviews you feature is completely normal and every shop does it; advertising a rating the displayed reviews don't support is the part that gets businesses in trouble. As built, you get the commercial benefit without the exposure.

## 8. Honest limitations

| Limitation | Why | Fix when budget allows |
|---|---|---|
| No card / net banking payments | Need a gateway merchant account | Razorpay/Cashfree — needs KYC + ~2% fee (section 5) |
| Payment is confirmed by the customer, not verified | No gateway to verify against | Same as above |
| The customer presses Send in WhatsApp | Auto-sending needs the paid WhatsApp Business API | WhatsApp Cloud API + a small backend |
| Stock is edited by hand, not deducted per sale | Nothing watches orders happen in real time | A small backend hook when the Razorpay integration lands |

Set up section 6 and the older limitations (no accounts, file-upload publishing, an insecure PIN) are solved. Without it, none of this blocks trading — thousands of Indian fabric businesses run exactly this way, confirming payment in their own UPI app before dispatching.

---

## 9. Deploying

**Quick:** drag `dist/` onto https://app.netlify.com/drop

**Proper:** push to GitHub → connect the repo on Netlify. `netlify.toml` is already configured (`npm run build` → publish `dist`). If you're using section 6, add the two `VITE_SUPABASE_*` environment variables in Netlify's site settings first.

**Day-to-day after that:** see section 2. With accounts and live sync, you never redeploy for a catalog change again. Rebuild by hand only when changing code, photos, or the files in `src/lib/constants.ts`.
