/**
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * Everything in this file is optional. The site works fully without it —
 * catalog editing via /#/admin + catalog.json, and WhatsApp-submitted
 * reviews — exactly as it did before. What Supabase adds on top, once
 * configured, is real accounts (Google or email+password+verification) for
 * anyone leaving a review, and changes the admin makes appearing live for
 * every visitor instead of needing a file upload.
 *
 * `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` come from a free project
 * at supabase.com. Until both are set, `isSupabaseConfigured` is false and
 * every piece of code that depends on this steps back to its non-Supabase
 * behaviour automatically — nothing breaks by leaving this unconfigured.
 *
 * See HANDOVER.md → "Accounts and live sync" for the exact setup steps.
