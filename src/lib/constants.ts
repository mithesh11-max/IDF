 *
 *  1. JSON FILE (default). The shop edits the catalog in the built-in editor at
 *     yoursite.com/#/admin, downloads `catalog.json`, and uploads that one file
 *     to the host. No rebuild, no npm, no developer.
 *
 *  2. GOOGLE SHEET. Set `sheetCsvUrl` below to a published-to-web Google Sheet
 *     (File → Share → Publish to web → choose the sheet → CSV). The shop then
 *     edits prices and stock in Google Sheets on their phone and the site
 *     picks it up within a few minutes. Leave as '' to stay on the JSON file.

 * JavaScript and anyone determined can read it. That is acceptable here only
 * because the editor cannot change the live site by itself: it just prepares a
 * file that someone with host access still has to upload. Never reuse a PIN
 * here that protects anything else.
